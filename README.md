# Puppy IDE

A simplified IDE for beginner programmers and use in Education.

## Nicholas's Thoughts

I'd love it to be in a single Python file that's copiously documented. Kids
should be able to edit their editor.

The icons are based upon FontAwesome and look similar to the ones used in the
online Python editor for the BBC micro:bit. FontAwesome have SVG sources
in their repos.

I believe the kids shouldn't have to think about their filesystem. Their new
files should simply live in a default directory with an obvious name. Perhaps
later we could version files in some way for the kids (with a time-machine
like slider to see the history).

The hex file generation is already done in another project. We just need to
plug it in.

I'd love a REPL.

Also, it'd be good to conect to the micro:bit, if plugged in, and provide a
serial connection to it's Python 3 REPL.

We should also be able to implement code snippets triggered by a hot-key.

Basically, less is more, KISS and this editor is for JUST the very fist steps.
Ergo, remove all possible distractions and keep the focus on writing simple
Python scripts.

Finally, I'm not precious about my code and welcome comments, constructive
critique and ideas. :-)
